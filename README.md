# Master-thesis
Here I present the code that I used for my master thesis, titled “Segmentation of local structures of  pigmented skin lesions in dermoscopy images”.

In this project we proposed an alternative solution to common segmentation networks for the particular problem stated in one of the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) challenges, ‘Lesion Attribute Detection’, from 2018 (https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2018/46/).
The goal of this challenge was to develop an algorithm that automatically predicts the location of five relevant types of dermoscopic attributes, established as clinically-meaningful visual skin lesion patterns, in dermoscopic images. 

For more details you can read the article that I wrote for my master's thesis in the attached pdf.
